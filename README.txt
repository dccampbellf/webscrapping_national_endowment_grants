PROJECT SUMMARY

In this project, I scrapped the National Endowment (NED) for Democracy's African sub-site to get all their project information (name, country, grant amount). 

I then had to clean it a bit, and export it as a csv. I was able to conduct a bit of analysis - such as their median grant amount for Africa - 50,000 USD; main countries
in which they work: the DRC, Ethiopia. 

In another project I did the same for NED's work in Latin America. There the median grant amount is roughly 55,000 USD. 

Not the most vigorous analysis-wise but that was not my objective here. I am really just trying to work getting the data.
